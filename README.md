# Welcome to My Allocine
***

## Task
The task is to work witha database containing multiple tables
The task is to write queries that would match the SQL request in the file.

## Description
I solved the problem by firstly creating a Ruby file named my_allocine.Ruby
I connected to the database with sqlite
I performed sqlite request by using sqlite> SELECT * FROM genres;
1001|Action
1002|Adventure
1003|Animation
1004|Biography
1005|Comedy
1006|Crime
1007|Drama
1008|Horror
1009|Music
1010|Mystery
1011|Romance
1012|Thriller
1013|War
sqlite>
I exited with ctrl D

## Installation
I downloaded a databased named wget https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-claris/movies.db


## Usage
To use this project, you need to write SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the given database tables. 
Looking at the code in the ruby file Here are the SQL queries corresponding to each request mentioned in the provided file, "my_allocine.rb":
Download the database,connect to the database and execute the query
```
./After executing a query,SQLite will display the result of the query on the screen.
You can exit SQLite by pressing Ctrl + D or by typing ".exit" at the SQLite prompt.
Here's an example of how you would use the SQLite command line tool to execute a query:
$ sqlite3 movies.db
SQLite version 3.32.3 2020-06-18 14:16:19
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM actors;
You would replace "SELECT * FROM actors;" with the specific SQL query you want to execute. 
Repeat the process for each SQL query mentioned in the "my_allocine.rb" file
```
